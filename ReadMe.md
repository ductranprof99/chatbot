1. run lib init.py to create profile folder and run bash shell
? do i need to add custom chrome file path or i just make it static for just myself

i made this for windows, and things you had to do first is make powershell run by default and
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
default path of chrome:
C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
